-- Step 1 Creating diagram -> on the outline, RC on myCar.impl and create diagram
-- to perform analysis you should have an implementation 
-- Step 2 RC on myCar.impl and select instantiate 
-- this will create a folder instances on the project folder.
-- Step 3 select the instance from the project explorer on left and goto Analysis menu, Budget, Calculate weight totals
-- Step 3 will create a folder reports, and an excel file inside
-- if you make a change, re-instantiate and perform step 3 again.
-- After creating and organizing diagrams, save them and do not create diagram next time, simply open them from diagrams folder
-- Generate report of flow analysis after flows are complete. After end to end flow.
